## Overview

This API is designed to facilitate the development of applications requiring a backend service with the following features:

- **RESTful API**: Adheres to REST principles for smooth integration with frontend applications.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into controllers, services, and routes to promote separation of concerns.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Utilizes MongoDB for data persistence, providing a flexible schema.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later): A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **npm** (v6 or later): The package manager for JavaScript.
- **MongoDB**: You can use either a local MongoDB instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   npm install
   cp .env.development.example .env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
   npm run dev
